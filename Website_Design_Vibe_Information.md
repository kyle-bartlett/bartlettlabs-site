Website Information To Help Claude:


"I need a complete brand and code overhaul for Bartlett Labs. We are moving away from 'Generic Tech' to a 'Modern Workshop' brand.  We are targeting local business owners who value handshakes and results.

To get leads in Crosby, Texas, my site needs to stop looking like a software manual and start looking like a trusted local partner’s workshop.

1. The Missing "Soul" (Visuals & Trust)The Problem: Currently, there isn't a single photo of a human on the site (besides the small bio pic). In a small town, people buy from the owner directly, not "Bartlett Labs. 

- The New "About Me" Section
Headline: From the Shop Floor to AI Engineering
""I grew up in a town of 1,000 people in rural Indiana, washing cars and working the shop floor at my family’s Ford dealership. I learned early on that in a small town, your reputation is everything. You treat people right, or you don't stay in business.

After 15 years in the corporate world—working for names like Apple and Sears and leading AI automation teams for global brands—I realized something: the businesses that need this technology the most are the ones being left behind by the 'big tech' firms.

I’m a Purdue-trained Industrial Engineer who isn't afraid to get my hands dirty. I built Bartlett Labs to bring high-level automation to the local guys. I’m here to bridge the gap between old-school service and the new world of AI. No jargon, no fluff—just systems that work as hard as you do."

'Rewrite the About section using the story of my upbringing in a small-town Ford dealership. The theme is: 'Purdue Engineering meets Small-Town Handshake. Born in a town of 1,000 in Indiana. Hand-washed cars at my family’s dealership. Purdue Engineering Grad. 15 years at places like Apple and Anchor. Now, I’m bringing those high-end tools back to the local businesses that actually keep the world running.'  Integrate the two narratives into a solid "About Me" 


- The New Photo Update: I need a high-quality "Hero" photo. Not in a suit, but in a nice button-down or a branded polo, perhaps with a tablet or in a workshop-style setting. 
- Video Update: Videos are non-negotiable: AI is "magic" to most people. I need a 60-second "Loom" video or screen recording showing a tool actually working. Example: Show a lead coming in on my phone and the AI replying instantly. Seeing is believing.

2. Visual Hero Update:(3D Component):

Implement an isometric 3D baseplate using Three.js. Build an isometric 'baseplate' (like a LEGO foundation) in a 3D workshop setting.

Animate solid blocks (Deep Navy, Burnt Orange, Sage Green) sliding into place.

Text on Blocks: Must be bold, high-contrast, and 100% readable. Labels: 'LEAD CAPTURE', 'AI FOLLOW-UP', 'AUTO-SCHEDULING', 'INVOICING'. 'CRM', 'SMS GENERATION


3.  Copy Overhaul (Tone: Trusted, Local, Expert):

The Strategy: "The Digital Shop Foreman"
In a small town, people don't buy "AI." They buy time and reliability.

The Problem: Local owners think AI is "magic" or "a scam."

The Solution: I'm a Purdue Engineer who grew up in a Ford dealership. We aren't selling them "Neural Networks"; We're building them a "Digital Shop Foreman" that handles the phones, the scheduling, and the paperwork while they’re out in the field.

Main Headline: 'World-class systems. Small-town values.'

Sub-headline: 'I’m an Industrial Engineer who grew up in a family Ford dealership. I don’t sell "AI fluff"—I build the sturdy, automated systems that give local business owners their Sundays back.'  --> Re-write all of the above area section 3 into a consistent flow. 


CTA: 'Request a 15-Min Efficiency Audit'

Remove all Calendly links from the website. Replace them with my new GoHighLevel Calendar. Ensure the calendar widget is styled to match our new Navy and Parchment 'Workshop' theme."

##Calendar Link && Embed Code

4. Design/CSS:

Change the background to a soft, warm parchment (#F5F3F0).

Use a rugged, clean sans-serif font (like Inter or Roboto) but use 'Slab' serifs for headlines to give it a 'Blueprint' feel.

Replace 'Industries We Serve' icons with custom-styled blocks for 'Service Pros', 'Logistics', and 'Health Clinics'."

What Needs to Go
The "Industry" Icons: Currently, they look like generic clip-art. If we use the "LEGO" theme, these should be 3D blocks or tactile blueprints.

The McKinsey Mention: It’s a great credential, but to a guy running a plumbing fleet in Crosby, it sounds "expensive and complicated."  Remove it from the main value prop.

Add a 'Why Crosby?' blurb at the bottom to ground it in the local community.

4.2) The "Proof" Screenshots: Don't just show abstract blocks. Show a blurry but recognizable screenshot of a Make.com workflow or a GoHighLevel dashboard. It proves I'm not just using ChatGPT; I'm building actual infrastructure.

4.3) The "Crosby" Touch: Please place a subtle image of a local landmark or a "Texas-grown" badge near the footer. It screams "I'm not a bot from overseas."

4.4) Video: The "Trust Accelerator"
The Idea: A 60-90 second video titled "A Message to Crosby Business Owners."

The Script: > "Hi, I'm Kyle. I spent 15 years in high-end tech, but I grew up in a family Ford dealership. I know what it's like when the phones are ringing, the paperwork is piling up, and you just want to get home to your family. I built Bartlett Labs to give you your time back using the same tech I used at Apple, but tailored for your shop. Here's a 10-second look at a system I just built for a local dispatcher..." (Show screen recording).


4.5) Testimonials (The "New Business" Workaround)
The Problem: I haven't made a sale yet.

The Fix: Don't lie, but don't look "empty." Replace the "Testimonials" section with "The Bartlett Guarantee" or "Beta Partner Spotlights."

Highlight a "Prototype" I've built. 
"The SMS Lead-Responder: Built to respond to leads in <2 minutes. Result: 100% response rate during testing."  This shows competence before you have clients.


4.6) The Tech Stack

Make.com (The Brain): This is where we build the logic. It’s more visual and powerful than Zapier. It looks like "Engineering," which fits my brand.

GoHighLevel (The Front-End): This is the CRM I'll sell to the clients. It handles the SMS, the calendars, and the lead tracking. Most "AI Agencies" are just white-labeling this and adding AI.

Eleven Lags/Vapi.ai or Retell AI (The Voice): Show them an AI that can actually answer their shop phone and book an appointment. It's the ultimate "Aha!" moment.

4.7) Replace generic 'Get Started' buttons with: 'Request a 10-Minute Efficiency Audit.'



1. The 'Efficiency Audit' Component:

Create a dedicated section (or a clean popup) for the '5-Minute Shop-Efficiency Audit.'

Copy: 'Don't know where to start? Take the 5-minute audit and get a custom automation blueprint for your shop.'

Embed: Leave a placeholder div where I can paste my GoHighLevel Form/Survey iframe code.

2. The Calendar Integration:

Update all 'Book a Call' and 'Efficiency Audit' buttons to link directly to my GoHighLevel Calendar widget.

Make sure the calendar loads in a clean modal or stays consistent with our 'Parchment' and 'Navy' workshop theme.

3. Visual Feedback:

When someone submits the form, show a 'Building your Blueprint...' animation using our 3D block style before showing the success message."


The "Auto-Response" Workflow: In the Automation tab, create a trigger: "When Form is Submitted" -> "Send Email with PDF Blueprint" -> "Wait 2 minutes" -> "Send SMS: 'Hey, it's Kyle. Just sent that blueprint over. If you have 2 minutes, the calendar link is here to walk through it.'"

####THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING IN GHL **FOR YOUR REFERENCE TO KNOW HOW THE GHL PIECE WILL WORK:
Gemini said
Let’s get this engine idling! Since you're sitting on a GoHighLevel (GHL) account at 90% completion, this survey is the final piece of the "Lead Capture" puzzle.

We want these questions to feel like a diagnostic check-up at a shop. We aren't asking about "API integrations"; we’re asking about where the grease is leaking in their business.

📋 The "Shop Efficiency Audit" Questions
In GoHighLevel, go to Sites > Surveys > Builder to create this.

Question 1: The Context

"What kind of outfit are you running?"
Options: [Service/Trades (Plumbing, AC, etc.)] | [Professional Services] | [Logistics/Shipping] | [Retail/Shopfront] | [Other]

Question 2: The Time Leak

"If you had to guess, how many hours a week do you (or your staff) spend on 'the boring stuff'—scheduling, invoicing, and manual data entry?"
Options: [1-5 Hours] | [5-10 Hours] | [10-20 Hours] | [I've lost count]

Question 3: The Biggest Headache

"What’s the one thing that keeps you from finishing your work on time?"
Options: [Chasing down unpaid invoices] | [Missing leads because I can't answer the phone] | [The mess of scheduling/calendars] | [Just too much manual paperwork]

Question 4: The Speed Test

"When a new lead hits your website or Facebook, how long does it usually take for someone to call or text them back?"
Options: [Under 5 minutes] | [Within an hour] | [Later that evening] | [Whenever I get a spare second]

Question 5: The Handshake (Open Ended)

"If I could build you a 'Digital Shop Foreman' to handle the busywork, what’s the first task you’d want off your plate?"
Short Answer box

Question 6: The Delivery (Contact Info)

"Where should I send your custom Automation Blueprint?"
Fields: First Name | Email | Phone Number

🗺️ The "Blueprint" Logic (What they get)
You don't need to write a unique 20-page book for every person. You create three template responses based on their answer to Question 3:

If they chose "Missing Leads": The Blueprint they get focuses on The Lead Wrangler (GHL's Auto-Missed Call Text Back and SMS Chatbots).

If they chose "Invoices/Paperwork": The Blueprint focuses on The Weekend Recovery (GHL's Invoicing and Workflow Automations).

If they chose "Scheduling": The Blueprint focuses on The Automated Calendar (That 0% item on your GHL dashboard!).

🛠️ Setting it up in GoHighLevel
Build the Survey: Use the questions above in the GHL Survey Builder.

The "Thank You" Page: After they hit submit, don't just say "Thanks." Redirect them to your GHL Calendar (the one that's currently at 0%) with a message: "Audit complete! Your blueprint is being generated. While you wait, let’s grab 10 minutes to walk through it."

The Automation: In the Automation tab, create a workflow:

Trigger: Survey Submitted.

Action: Send Email (attach a simple PDF or a link to a 'results' page).

Action: Send SMS (to yourself) telling you a new lead from Crosby just finished the audit!

########








4.8) Add a "Privacy & Security" popup or small section. Small business owners are terrified of "AI leaking their data." You need a section titled: "Your Data Stays Yours. Period."
In the footer, add a 'Security First' badge with text: 'Built on enterprise-grade infrastructure. Your business data never trains public AI models.'



5. Here is what I want to convey and hopefully why this will get me sales. I need you to help convey all of this into my website design. Since I'm targeting Crosby/Houston suburbs:

The Handshake: Mentioning I'm a "Purdue Engineer" gives me the "Nerdy" credibility.

The Shop: Mentioning the Ford dealership gives me the "Hillbilly" (Local) credibility.

The Combination: People will feel safe hiring me because I've worked at Apple, but they'll like hiring me because I know what it's like to work a Saturday at a dealership.

When a Crosby business owner lands on this, they’re going to see:

Credibility: "He worked at Apple and went to Purdue? Okay, he knows his stuff."

Relatability: "He grew up in a car dealership? He knows how hard it is to run a shop."

Clarity: "He builds systems that save me time. I get it."


6. 🛠️ The "Plain English" Service Menu
These replace my current generic service descriptions. We’re naming them based on the problem they solve, not the tech they use. 

The 'Service Menu' Architecture

Create three distinct cards:

6.1) The Lead Wrangler (Focus: Never miss a call/text).
(Lead Capture & Follow-up)

What it is: A system that grabs every lead from your site, Facebook, or phone and texts them back in under 2 minutes.

The Hook: "If you’re out in the field and can’t answer the phone, you’re losing money. We make sure your business 'talks' to customers even when you’re under a hood or on a job site."

The Goal: Stop losing money on missed calls.	

Best For: Plumbers, AC Repair, Landscapers.

6.2) The Weekend Recovery (Focus: Automating the boring admin).

What it is: We take the spreadsheets, invoicing, and scheduling off your plate.

The Hook: "Most owners spend their Sundays catching up on paperwork. We build the 'digital gears' that handle your admin work automatically, so you can actually enjoy your weekend."

The Goal: Automate the "Sunday Paperwork."	

Best For: Small fleets, Retailers, Dispatchers.

6.3) The Custom Lab Build (Focus: High-end engineering; Advanced AI & Dashboards)

What it is: High-end engineering for specialized problems.

The Hook: "For the business that has grown too complex for off-the-shelf software.                             

Add a prominent 'Efficiency Audit' form.

Add a 'Proof of Concept' section where I can easily embed videos of the automations I've built."

The Goal: A custom engine for a complex shop.

Best For: Logistics, Health Clinics, Manufacturers.



7) CRM/Lead Flow - I'm using Go High Level

📝 Website Integration)

"Claude, we are adding the 'Lead Magnet' to the home page.

Create a high-impact section titled: 'Find the Leaks in Your Business.'

Add copy: 'Take the 5-Minute Efficiency Audit. I’ll send you a custom Blueprint showing exactly which tasks you can automate to save 10+ hours a week.'

Embed the GoHighLevel Survey iframe here: [PASTE YOUR GHL SURVEY IFRAME CODE HERE].

Ensure the section looks like a 'Diagnostic Tool'—clean lines, high contrast, and tactile buttons."**

Why it works: It feels like a professional service, not a sales pitch. It also gives you all the data you need to close the sale before you even get on the phone.


7.2) The Calendar Integration:

Update all 'Book a Call' and 'Efficiency Audit' buttons to link directly to my GoHighLevel Calendar widget.

Make sure the calendar loads in a clean modal or stays consistent with our 'Parchment' and 'Navy' workshop theme.

7.3) Visual Feedback:

When someone submits the form, show a 'Building your Blueprint...' animation using our 3D block style before showing the success message."


8) Since we’re moving from "Generic Tech" to "The Digital Workshop," we need to address the two biggest elephants in the room for a local business owner: "Is my data safe?" and "How much is this actually going to cost me?"

Here is "the rest" of the toolkit to make Bartlett Labs a powerhouse in Crosby.

8.1) 🛡️ Section 1: The "Digital Vault" (Security & Privacy)
Local business owners are terrified that AI will "leak" their customer lists or "learn" their trade secrets and give them to a competitor. You need to kill that fear on the landing page.

Headline: Your Data Stays in Your Shop.

"I’m an engineer, not a data broker. At Bartlett Labs, we use 'Private-Instance' AI. This means the systems we build for you are walled off. Your customer names, your pricing, and your internal processes are never used to train public AI models like ChatGPT. It’s your intellectual property—we just give it an engine."

The "Three-Lock" Guarantee:

Encrypted & Local: We use enterprise-grade encryption for every automation.

No Data Training: Your data is never 'fed' back into the AI to help it learn for others.

You Own the Keys: If we stop working together, you keep the systems. We don't 'rent' you your own business logic.

8.2) 💵 Section 2: The "Service Menu" & Pricing Logic
In a small town, "Request a Quote" often feels like "I'm going to charge you whatever I think you can afford." Transparency builds trust. Even if you don't list exact prices, listing Starting At prices or Value Metrics helps.


9) Add a 'Security & Privacy' Section:

Title: 'Your Data Stays in Your Shop.'

Use the 'Three-Lock Guarantee' text (Encrypted, No Data Training, You Own the Keys).

Use a subtle 'Safe/Vault' icon style that matches our 3D blocks.

10)Add a 'Common Sense FAQ' Section:

Use a clean accordion style.

Include questions about replacing staff, ease of use, and the difference between 'Raw AI' and 'Bartlett Systems.'

11) Update the Footer:

Add a 'Hand-Built in Texas' badge.

Ensure the 'Efficiency Audit' call to action is repeated at the very bottom.

12) Mobile Optimization:

Ensure the 3D 'Lego' baseplate scales down correctly for mobile users. Local guys will be looking at this on their phones at a job site—it has to be fast and readable."

And it actuality...We have to make sure the ENTIRE WEBSITE is mobile friendly because most of our customers are not going to be always sitting at their desk.  

🏁 Final Summary of the "Bartlett Labs" Vision:
The Brand: The "Nerdy Hillbilly" (Purdue Engineer + Ford Dealer).

The Look: The Modern Workshop (3D LEGO Blocks, Navy/Orange, Parchment).

The Engine: GoHighLevel (Automated Calendars, Surveys, and SMS).

The Hook: The 5-Minute Efficiency Audit.

The "Shop Efficiency Audit" Questions:


💡Since I'm 37, a Purdue Grad, and a local guy, your "handshake" is worth more than any AI. When I  get a notification that someone finished this audit, text them personally. "Hey, it's Kyle from Bartlett Labs. I just saw your audit—looks like invoicing is eating your Sundays. I’ve got a couple of ideas on how to fix that. You got 5 minutes tomorrow morning?"

💡Final Advice: The "Nerdy Hillbilly" Edge
Don't be afraid to be "too country" or "too nerdy." The intersection is where the money is.

The "Hillbilly" makes them trust I won't rip them off.


POTENTIAL USE CASES OF ANIMATION AND BUTTONS (ONLY IF YOU AGREE). I don't know if these fit our vibes but 
## Design Principles
- Use HeroUI for all components.
- Palette: Soft neutrals (Stone/Zinc) with a Sage Green primary accent.
- Animation: Always use Framer Motion for transitions; keep them subtle (duration: 0.3s).
- Radius: Use 'xl' or '2xl' for all cards and buttons.
